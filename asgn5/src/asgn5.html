  who will win the race?
  There is a blueshell, locked onto the mclaren, is about to land, there is the revuelto trying to avoid the banana peel<br>
   the batmobile launched a bobomb which is about to land, the red shell behind sonic, the green shell about to hit the ferrari and a bullet bill in last place :(
    There are item blocks around the map
